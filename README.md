## search-github-repos
This project was a test to improve my React skills and fetching some information from API's. Altough this site is live at https://murat-karakaya.github.io/search-github-repos/ You don't really need this website. Github search bar is much better ;)

#### Note: there is a weird, verry annoying error. That's why the website doesn't works. The strange thing is that this website used to work.
